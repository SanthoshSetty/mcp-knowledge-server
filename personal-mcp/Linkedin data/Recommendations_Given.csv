Winnie,Wong,Apple,"Business Manager, South Asia Sales","I have had the pleasure of working with Winnie as she has managed a number of high impact projects at the Global Fashion Group, including Process Improvement, Cost Analysis, Operations, and Systems Implementation. Not only is she easy to work with, but she manages in a well-organized and proactive manner.    Winnie worked as the project manager in on-boarding a global marketplace partner. During the process, she was effective in communicating with key stakeholders and keeping everyone in the project on task by sorting through competing priorities and working through complexities across multiple departments.     Winnie always sets a high standard for the team with her hard work and project management skills. The quality that distinguishes her from the rest is her ability to approach high stake situations with a clear mind and focused approach, a key skill which I had the opportunity to learn from her. Aside from her obvious leadership skills, I have also seen Winnie demonstrate strong analytical skills through leading investigations into revenue and cost structures across various business models.     As a manager, Winnie is reliable, detail oriented, and a team player who approaches her work with the best interests of the organization and its customers in mind. Because of these strengths, Winnie would be a valuable asset to any organization.","04/11/17, 07:54 AM",
