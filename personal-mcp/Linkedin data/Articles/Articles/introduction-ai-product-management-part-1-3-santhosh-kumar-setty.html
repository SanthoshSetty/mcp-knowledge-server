These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding natural language. From its roots in the 1950s, AI has grown to become a technology that influences many aspects of our daily lives.</p><p></p><h3>Here is a brief map of its timeline</h3><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4E12AQGdGgy7rttOlQ" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQGdGgy7rttOlQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1693312153709?e=1755734400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Ogo3HTqc_8t23biR9pTJ9iRERERmrQo-L_Y5EFzXIFo"><figcaption>AI evolution since 1950s</figcaption></figure><h2>Sub-Divisions of AI</h2><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4E12AQEHsyurDQA0Iw" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQEHsyurDQA0Iw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1693321489924?e=1755734400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=MS0g23cGuDTjyn1obxboZQgh3hl86G55wFBQrTHH_hU"><figcaption>Subdivisions of AI. Image courtesy- Google's introduction to generative AI.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><p><strong>Machine Learning: </strong>This is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms enabling computers to learn from data. For example, Google's search algorithm uses machine learning to provide you with the most relevant search results.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> Deep learning is a specialized area within machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to analyze different aspects of data. For example, Facial recognition systems, commonly used in security measures, are a practical application of deep learning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI</strong>: Both Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are subdivisions within the realm of Deep Learning, which is itself a subset of machine learning. While they share common foundational technologies like neural networks, they serve different specialized functions. Generative AI is a broader category focused on creating new data that resembles a given dataset; this can include generating images, music, or text. On the other hand, LLMs are specifically engineered for language tasks, excelling in generating human-like text based on the data they've been trained on. They can perform a variety of tasks such as answering questions, summarizing text, and even writing code. In essence, LLMs are a particular type of Generative AI that specializes in understanding and generating text.</p></li></ul><h2>AI Products Before the Gen AI Era</h2><p>Before the rise of General AI, the landscape of AI products was a mixed bag of specialized, yet impactful, technologies and ambitious projects that revealed the limitations of early AI. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson" target="_blank">IBM's Watson</a>, for example, was tailored for natural language processing and data analytics, gaining fame for outperforming humans on the quiz show "<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ibm-watson-the-inside-story-of-how-the-jeopardy-winning-supercomputer-was-born-and-what-it-wants-to-do-next/" target="_blank">Jeopardy</a>!". While Watson excelled in sectors like healthcare, it was largely confined to the tasks it was specifically programmed for.</p><p>Chatbots like <a href="https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html" target="_blank">ELIZA</a> served as early examples of automated customer service, but their capabilities were limited to scripted responses and keyword matching. Despite these limitations, some pioneering AI projects showcased the potential of AI in real-world applications. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-has-a-website-takes-the-face-swapping-craze-to-hilarious-new-levels-its-super-addictive-2016-3" target="_blank">Microsoft's Project Murphy</a>, an AI-powered chatbot introduced in 2016, was designed to answer hypothetical questions and even merge two images into a humorous composite, demonstrating the potential for AI in creative applications.</p><p>Another Microsoft initiative, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist" target="_blank">Tay bot</a>, was a machine learning project aimed at understanding conversational language but ran into issues due to its inability to filter inappropriate content. Though Tay bot was a cautionary tale in AI development, it contributed valuable lessons about the importance of ethical considerations and data filtering.</p><p>On the successful side, machine learning algorithms have had notable successes, especially in the realm of data analytics, predictive modeling, and automation. In finance, machine learning models have been effectively used for risk assessment, fraud detection, and market trend analysis, proving the utility of AI in specialized tasks. These algorithms, although not as versatile as General AI, have been instrumental in solving specific problems, paving the way for the more advanced AI technologies we see today.</p><h2>Gen AI Era and Product Development</h2><p>The advent of General AI has ushered in a transformative phase for product development, offering capabilities that go far beyond the specialized tasks that earlier AI technologies could handle. For instance, OpenAI's GPT-3 gained widespread attention for its ability to perform a multitude of functions, from code generation to answering complex queries and even composing music. Its successor, <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4" target="_blank">GPT-4</a>, has further pushed the boundaries, offering even more robust and versatile functionalities. These advanced models have lowered the barriers to integrating sophisticated AI features into products, as they can often replace traditional machine learning models with a simple API call and a prompt.</p><p>Similarly, other platforms like Google's <a href="https://developers.generativeai.google/" target="_blank">PALM API</a> and Meta's Llama 2 have emerged as powerful tools in this new era. PALM API offers advanced language understanding capabilities, while <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" target="_blank">Llama 2</a> specializes in multi-modal learning, combining text and image understanding.
