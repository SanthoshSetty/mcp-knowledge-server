  <div><h3>Introduction </h3><p>In my journey as a product manager, leveraging GPT and other advanced tools has transformed how I work. These technologies have streamlined my methodologies significantly. This article focuses on how generative AI can empower data-driven decision-making in product management.</p><h3>What is Data-Driven Product Management? </h3><p>Product managers depend on data to inform their decisions. Growth PMs might concentrate on metrics like user acquisition and engagement, whereas Technical PMs may prioritize product reliability and development cycle time. Data Product Managers often focus on data quality. The product type typically dictates the choice of metrics. Most PMs rely on established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and industry benchmarks. These metrics provide a baseline for assessing product performance and identifying areas for improvement. However, an exclusive focus on traditional metrics can inhibit innovation and limit a product’s potential. While predefined KPIs are straightforward and easy to track, they may not fully address the specific needs of the target audience.</p><h3>Customized Approach in Product Management </h3><p>Success measurement in product management requires a tailored approach. Each product demands unique metrics reflecting its audience, objectives, and market. Traditional metrics like user engagement and customer satisfaction are useful but may not encompass all nuances of a product’s success. AI introduces a novel, data-driven approach to KPI selection that transcends traditional methods. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of user behavior data, market trends, and customer feedback to uncover patterns and insights previously hidden.</p><p>For instance, Instacart utilizes ChatGPT APIs to enhance search functionalities for customers. When customers seek specific recipes or ingredients, the new search function enabled by ChatGPT APIs provides only relevant results. In a comparable manner, generative AI, when linked to a comprehensive database, can propose insights for product optimization or identify new prospects. For effective utilization, it's essential for AI to comprehend the PM's role, the product, and the business context.</p><h3>Hypothetical Scenario: A Growth PM in a SaaS Company </h3><p>Imagine a Growth PM in a SaaS company focussing on overall growth of the company through Product. Let's consider a KPI tree that is linked from top (Revenue) to Down (Conversion Rate, Traffic etc). KPI trees link minor initiatives to the company’s broader goals and financial objectives. For the sake of this article, lets consider a tree just as given below. </p><p></p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4E12AQFLEGadGY4J3w" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQFLEGadGY4J3w/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1702298804823?e=1755734400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=NFxQSL0akK8HTHlO435gkn60XkztrSv5GILmEs1Twjc"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Initially, we utilize the KPI tree as a primary reference for our analysis. When formulating prompts for Gen AI, we have the flexibility to either focus specifically on insights within the scope of the KPI tree or, when necessary, to broaden our inquiry beyond it, inviting more creative, 'out-of-the-box' analysis</p><h3>Integrating Gen AI with the KPI Tree </h3><p>Gen AI can provide deeper insights from the KPI tree. For instance, if 'Customer Churn Rate' is a key KPI, Gen AI can analyze and predict factors influencing this rate. An effective Gen AI prompt could be, "Analyze the correlation between customer support response time and customer churn rate over the last quarter." This analysis aids PMs in understanding customer experience elements affecting churn.</p><h3>Crafting Effective Gen AI Prompts </h3><p>Creating clear, focused, and relevant prompts is crucial for extracting valuable insights from Gen AI. PMs should formulate questions answerable by the available data, ensuring that the insights generated are actionable and directly relevant to their product strategy.</p><h3>Some Sample Prompts for Gen AI Analysis</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Growth Stagnation</strong>: "Using our KPI tree data, identify the top three reasons for this month's growth stagnation. Analyze relevant metrics to determine the primary factors contributing to this slowdown."</p></li><li><p><strong>Customer Churn Analysis</strong>: "Review the Customer Churn Rate and Net Promoter Score (NPS) for the last quarter. Determine the primary reasons for customer attrition and suggest product or service changes to reduce churn."</p></li><li><p><strong>Feature Adoption Insights</strong>: "Evaluate the adoption rates of our latest features. Compare these rates with customer feedback and usage data to understand why certain features are not widely adopted."</p></li><li><p><strong>Marketing Strategy Effectiveness</strong>: "Assess our recent marketing campaigns' impact on Lead Conversion Rates and Website Traffic. Identify the most and least effective campaigns and why, based on the data."</p></li><li><p><strong>Product Development Cycle Efficiency</strong>: "Analyze our Product Development Cycle Time and its correlation with market response to recent launches. Determine if the development cycle length is affecting our product's market performance and suggest ways to optimize it."</p></li></ul><h3>Overcoming Challenges in Gen AI Integration </h3><p>Integrating Gen AI in traditional product management can present challenges like data quality and system compatibility. Ensuring comprehensive, accurate, and regularly updated data is essential for Gen AI effectiveness. Technical expertise may be required to integrate Gen AI seamlessly into existing systems.</p><h3>Methods of Integration in Workflow</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Integration with databases directly</strong>: Smooth integration can be achieved by function calling, passing specific parameters when integrating <a href="https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates" target="_blank">OpenAI with databases</a>. Companies can develop a simple interface for effective querying. Depending on the techstack you use, there are other similar solutions as well. Here is a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-data-qna" target="_blank">comprehensive guide by Google</a> on how to achieve this with Lookerstudio. If you are using SAP, refer to this guide on how to integrate <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2023/09/03/generative-ai-for-sap-part-iii.-llms-with-database-queries-using-natural-language-nlq/" target="_blank">SAP with Gen AI</a> . If you are a Microsoft Fan using Power BI, refer to this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric" target="_blank">article</a> on how to enable it for your you. </p></li><li><p><strong>Working with Excel sheets</strong>: If database integration isn't feasible, PMs can use Python to parse Excel sheets and call OpenAI to analyze data with specific prompts. Alternatively, they can activate Python within Excel and enable OpenAI integration.</p></li></ol><h3>The Future of Product Management with Gen AI </h3><p>The integration of Generative AI into product management heralds a promising future. Gen AI's ability to provide deep, actionable insights empowers PMs to anticipate market changes, understand customer needs more profoundly, and innovate more effectively. This insight level can lead to more targeted product development, smarter resource allocation, and a stronger market position.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Incorporating Generative AI into the product management process marks a revolutionary shift from traditional KPI-driven strategies. Gen AI enhances understanding of existing metrics and uncovers new avenues for innovation and growth. By leveraging Gen AI in conjunction with a comprehensive KPI tree, PMs can make more informed, data-driven decisions that align closely with customer needs and business objectives. </p><p></p></div>
