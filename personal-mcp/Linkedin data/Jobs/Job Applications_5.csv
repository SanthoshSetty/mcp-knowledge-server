With more than 7 years of experience in Product Management and Analytics across e-commerce and consulting companies, I have a proven passion for developing innovative solutions that combine cutting-edge technology and complex data with a deep understanding of customers’ needs. During my current role in Alibaba’s Lazada.com, I am responsible for coordinating the full product-development lifecycle for store pages in Lazmall division, including strategic planning, requirements analysis, QA testing, and product launches. My ability to ensure stakeholder buy-in and promote team collaboration using Agile methodologies, allowed me to successfully launch data products which are being consumed by global cross-functional teams. In this role, I had a good understanding of customer motivation and the ability for proactively addressing market shifts. I excel at working in an environment where I’m faced with significant engineering challenges such as managing accelerated infrastructure growth and dealing with huge load spikes (100x), during campaign times.   In my previous role in Zalora.com, I have an extensive background in both market research and Agile methodology. I leveraged my expertise to establish new protocols for defining product requirements, developing user stories, and creating effective product roadmaps. In Zalora, I worked on automating pricing operations by building Pricing product, which automates price change decisions taken by the category teams. Through this project, I also worked on enhancing the middleware product between sellers and the website.   In my previous role in Redmart.com, I worked on Customer Segmentation, User research and Supply Chain analytics for developing a demand planning platform. Within a short time, I was able to deliver this project on time, as I based my decisions on data rather than opinions or assumptions. The Project yielded in reducing the stock holding by $3M.   I  also worked as a Data Analytics Engineer with the consulting arm of Indian Conglomerate, Larsen and Toubro, where I worked on developing intelligent data-driven solutions for OEM clients. I am always passionate about product development and I constantly look for ways to improve and optimize. I have excellent communication skills and I consistently work on agile techniques for Product Development.   In the past few years, I have always thrived in a constantly changing environment. I am always User-focused and customer-centric while creating significant business impact. Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more about the Product Manager position and Booking.com. I’m eager for the opportunity to bring my unique blend of technical and leadership skills to work with Trade Gecko to develop innovative solutions.   Regards,  Santhosh Kumar Sampangi Ramasetty  "

With more than 7 years of experience in Product Management and Analytics across e-commerce and consulting companies, I have a proven passion for developing innovative solutions that combine cutting-edge technology and complex data with a deep understanding of customers’ needs. During my current role in Alibaba’s Lazada.com, I am responsible for coordinating the full product-development lifecycle for store pages in Lazmall division, including strategic planning, requirements analysis, QA testing, and product launches. My ability to ensure stakeholder buy-in and promote team collaboration using Agile methodologies, allowed me to successfully launch data products which are being consumed by global cross-functional teams. In this role, I had a good understanding of customer motivation and the ability for proactively addressing market shifts. I excel at working in an environment where I’m faced with significant engineering challenges such as managing accelerated infrastructure growth and dealing with huge load spikes (100x), during campaign times.   In my previous role in Zalora.com, I have an extensive background in both market research and Agile methodology. I leveraged my expertise to establish new protocols for defining product requirements, developing user stories, and creating effective product roadmaps. In Zalora, I worked on automating pricing operations by building Pricing product, which automates price change decisions taken by the category teams. Through this project, I also worked on enhancing the middleware product between sellers and the website.   In my previous role in Redmart.com, I worked on Customer Segmentation, User research and Supply Chain analytics for developing a demand planning platform. Within a short time, I was able to deliver this project on time, as I based my decisions on data rather than opinions or assumptions. The Project yielded in reducing the stock holding by $3M.   I  also worked as a Data Analytics Engineer with the consulting arm of Indian Conglomerate, Larsen and Toubro, where I worked on developing intelligent data-driven solutions for OEM clients. I am always passionate about product development and I constantly look for ways to improve and optimize. I have excellent communication skills and I consistently work on agile techniques for Product Development.   In the past few years, I have always thrived in a constantly changing environment. I am always User-focused and customer-centric while creating significant business impact. Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more about the Product Manager position and Booking.com. I’m eager for the opportunity to bring my unique blend of technical and leadership skills to work with Trade Gecko to develop innovative solutions.

With more than 7 years of experience in Product Management and Analytics across e-commerce and consulting companies, I have a proven passion for developing innovative solutions that combine cutting-edge technology and complex data with a deep understanding of customers’ needs. During my current role in Alibaba’s Lazada.com, I am responsible for coordinating the full product-development lifecycle for store pages in Lazmall division, including strategic planning, requirements analysis, QA testing, and product launches. My ability to ensure stakeholder buy-in and promote team collaboration using Agile methodologies, allowed me to successfully launch data products which are being consumed by global cross-functional teams. In this role, I had a good understanding of customer motivation and the ability for proactively addressing market shifts. I excel at working in an environment where I’m faced with significant engineering challenges such as managing accelerated infrastructure growth and dealing with huge load spikes (100x), during campaign times.   In my previous role in Zalora.com, I have an extensive background in both market research and Agile methodology. I leveraged my expertise to establish new protocols for defining product requirements, developing user stories, and creating effective product roadmaps. In Zalora, I worked on automating pricing operations by building Pricing product, which automates price change decisions taken by the category teams. Through this project, I also worked on enhancing the middleware product between sellers and the website.   In my previous role in Redmart.com, I worked on Customer Segmentation, User research and Supply Chain analytics for developing a demand planning platform. Within a short time, I was able to deliver this project on time, as I based my decisions on data rather than opinions or assumptions. The Project yielded in reducing the stock holding by $3M.   I  also worked as a Data Analytics Engineer with the consulting arm of Indian Conglomerate, Larsen and Toubro, where I worked on developing intelligent data-driven solutions for OEM clients. I am always passionate about product development and I constantly look for ways to improve and optimize. I have excellent communication skills and I consistently work on agile techniques for Product Development.   In the past few years, I have always thrived in a constantly changing environment. I am always User-focused and customer-centric while creating significant business impact. Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more about the Product Manager position and Booking.com. I’m eager for the opportunity to bring my unique blend of technical and leadership skills to work with Trade Gecko to develop innovative solutions.
