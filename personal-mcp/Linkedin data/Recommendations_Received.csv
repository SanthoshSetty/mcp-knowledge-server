Jonathan,Woods,Sedex,Senior software engineer at Sedex for Equal Experts,"Santhosh and I worked together at Wayfair.  I soon came to appreciate the depth of his insight and knowledge, his calm approach, his supportiveness and his enviable dry sense of humour!  Among other things we were developing software for warehouse associates, and it was inspirational to see Santhosh equally happy wearing a high-vis vest and scanning cartons, juggling development team priorities in planning and refinement meetings, or breaking out a SQL client to perform some ad hoc data analysis.  I'd love to work with him again.","05/05/23, 07:37 AM",VISIBLE
Daniel,Bregler,KWA Analytics,Principal Consultant,"Working with Santhosh as my product manager counterpart at Wayfair was the greatest pleasure. Seriously! What a guy ! He has fantastic problem-solving skills and deep understanding of his product lines day in and out. We also travelled to warehouses together frequently; He made those trips always a success. He made sure our business objectives were met and we brought clear action items back for development. It goes without saying, that Santhosh is extremely well organized, always prepared and methodical.  His ability to successfully context-switch is second to none. On the same day, he produces complex data analysis on a high-priority incident while also producing clear and intriguing process instructions.  Every organization will be thankful for Santhosh's dedication to finding solutions and his drive for results.  Santhosh possesses an excellent technical understanding and a deep understanding of supply chain and data analytics. His ability to apply technical knowledge to real-world situations was truly remarkable and is found few and far between! Santhosh can give roadmap presentations in front of a board of directors with the same ease with which he spends time in the warehouse scanning boxes at 5 am with associates!  So in my view not only is he extremely competent but he is also a genuine and open-hearted person whom - I like so many others - really enjoyed spending time with him - he will be missed!","02/08/23, 09:08 PM",VISIBLE

Winnie,Wong,Apple,"Business Manager, South Asia Sales","I've worked with Santhosh on multiple projects throughout his time at the Global Fashion Group.     One project that stood out to me clearly was when we were developing a solution for a new global partner. Prior to the project, he had taken on the initiative to document every minute detail of each of our marketplace ventures, thereby becoming the subject matter expert in global logistics practices. Not only had he process-mapped every venture, but he also maintained the records of all shipping documents, which were key to helping us build the end-to-end cross-border solution within an overnight turnaround.     Santhosh also worked on another project that supported the local marketplace teams, segmenting sellers based on performance. He implemented a machine learning-based seller ranking feature that rated sellers based on order-processing efficiency, cancellations and returns rates.    This level of exhaustive detail has been evident in the other projects he has worked on and therefore I believe he would be able to add great value to any organization in the future.","03/22/17, 03:25 PM",VISIBLE
