But, fear not! Here are some unique ways that could aid you with job search""
""""
""1️⃣ Maximize Google Job Search:🌐 ""
""Don't restrict yourself to LinkedIn or specific job portals. Broaden your horizons using Google Jobs with tailored search terms. For instance, paste this query into the Google search box and navigate to the Jobs page (thanks Jay Gohil for the useful tip): ""
""```""
""(""Area of Interest 1"" OR ""Area of Interest 2"" OR ""Area of Interest 3"" OR ""Area of Interest 4"") AND ""Job Title"" ""Location""""
""```""
""For instance, if you're an analyst seeking supply chain vacancies in Singapore, your query could be:""
""```""
""(""Supply chain"" OR ""fulfilment"" OR ""Logistics"" OR Warehouse) AND ""Analyst"" Singapore . I have added a link in the comments incase if you want to go to thespecific page. ""
""```""
""Google Jobs will display consolidated list of jobs from several portals . I have posted an example link in the comments. ""
""""
""2️⃣ Leverage LinkedIn Connections: 💼 ""
""Your network is potent. A simple LinkedIn post detailing your situation and future needs can get you a job. Reach out to your LinkedIn connections and see if they can assist or refer you. ""
""""
""3️⃣ Match Resume with Job Description using ChatGPT or any other AI tool: 🤖 ""
""AI tools like ChatGPT can assess how well your resume aligns with a job description. If the match score is below 70%, consider revising your resume to better fit the job's requirements. For instance, you could prompt ChatGPT like this to get a match score and areas of improvement:""
""""
""```""
""Hey ChatGPT, Please provide an estimate of the match percentage by comparing key qualifications and experiences in the resume with the requirements in the job description.""
""Job Description: [JD]""
""Resume: [Your Resume]""
""```""
""""
""4️⃣ Hone Your Skills with Business Cases and Mock Interviews: 📚 ""
""Most job roles involve multiple interview rounds, including business case evaluations. Practice can make the difference. Be it engineering, business, or operations roles, case study  rounds are common. ""
""""
""Check freeCodeCamp , Exponent, Bain & Company for Mock Interviews. Check Product School and  HBR business cases for Business case rounds.  Check LeetCode and HackerRank for coding practice. These are some examples of where you can start. ""
""""
""5️⃣ Work with Recruitment Agencies:🤝 ""
""Recruiters can be your secret weapon, leading you to unadvertised vacancies. In my experience, recruiters have been my biggest asset in the job search. Some of them who helped me are transparent® Trust In SODA LikeMind Recruitment Michael Page Orange Quarter Robert Walters. ""
""""
""Each job search journey is unique. Persistence, networking, and continuous learning are your best tools. Best of luck! 🍀""

""""
""🔔 Heads up to all community builders, developers, and tech enthusiasts. A recent example from Reddit underlines the crucial role of user sentiment in maintaining and growing an online community.""
""""
""Reddit, the popular discussion platform, recently decided to monetize its API. This decision impacts third-party applications like Apollo, a widely-used Reddit client, which now faces higher operating costs. Reddit's decision to charge for previously free API endpoints was made without consulting the community, causing a significant backlash. 🌪️""
""""
""The reaction? Many subreddit moderators, frustrated with the lack of communication and potential impacts on their communities, made their subreddits private in protest. This move illustrates the power of user sentiment, and how ignoring it can lead to unforeseen consequences. As of writing this post, around 60% of subreddits went dark. ""
""""
""The takeaway? Whether you're running a start-up, a tech giant, or a local online forum, always consider the sentiment of your users before implementing major changes. 🗣️ User sentiment is not just a metric - it's the heartbeat of your community. Neglecting it can set off a downward spiral that could be challenging to control.""
