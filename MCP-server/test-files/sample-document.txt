Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Key concepts include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

API Design:
Good API design follows principles like consistency, simplicity, and clear documentation. RESTful APIs should use proper HTTP methods, status codes, and have intuitive URL structures.

Project Management:
Effective project management involves planning, organizing, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. Common methodologies include Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall.

Software Engineering:
Best practices in software engineering include code review, testing, documentation, version control, and following design patterns for maintainable and scalable applications.
